# Arithmetic API
> Provide two Web API endpoints for evaluating very basic arithmetic expressions: you need to support only subtraction (-) and addition (+). One endpoint should refuse to operate on negative numbers in the expression, the other doesn’t have this restriction.
> Prove that your code works with unit tests. Document the design choices you make during the process (or anything else you see worthwhile).
> The submission should be a git repository containing the solution written in C#.
